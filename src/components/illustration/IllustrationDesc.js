            I also happen to be a digital illustrator. I've been drawing since I
            could hold a pencil and it's been my passion and side hobby since. I
            love drawing landscapes and fanart inspired from my favorite movies
            or games.
            <br />
            <br />I do commmissions in my free time! I've gone from mouse
            drawing on MS Paint, to tablet drawing on Paint Tool SAI, and now I
            mainly work with Adobe Procreate and Photoshop.
