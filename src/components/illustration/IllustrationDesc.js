            I also happen to be a digital illustrator. I've been drawing since I
            could hold a pencil and it's been my passion and side hobby since. I
            love drawing landscapes and fanart inspired from my favorite movies
            or games.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've gone from drawing in MS Paint with a mouse, to Paint Tool SAI
            with my first tablet, and now I mainly work with Adobe Procreate on
            my iPad and Photoshop.
